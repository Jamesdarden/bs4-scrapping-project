# bs4-scrapping-project

This project uses beautiful soupe to scrape search engines for fake PC Matic support sites offering phone support.

The program first sends the request to  adocker splash image to render the javascript on the page then scraps the link and text from the seach results and then saves the data in pandas dataframe. That data frame is then given a shady score and then filtered into a csv file after.
